	abstract = {Since the cost of communication (moving data) greatly exceeds the cost of doing arithmetic on current and future computing platforms, we are motivated to devise algorithms that communicate as little as possible, even if they do slightly more arithmetic, and as long as they still get the right answer. This paper is about getting the right answer for such an algorithm. It discusses {CALU}, a communication avoiding {LU} factorization algorithm based on a new pivoting strategy, that we refer to as tournament pivoting. The reason to consider {CALU} is that it does an optimal amount of communication, and asymptotically less than Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting ({GEPP}), and so will be much faster on platforms where communication is expensive, as shown in previous work. We show that the Schur complement obtained after each step of performing {CALU} on a matrix A is the same as the Schur complement obtained after performing {GEPP} on a larger matrix whose entries are the same as the entries of A (sometimes slightly perturbed) and zeros. More generally, the entire {CALU} process is equivalent to {GEPP} on a large, but very sparse matrix, formed by entries of A and zeros. Hence we expect that {CALU} will behave as {GEPP} and it will also be very stable in practice. In addition, extensive experiments on random matrices and a set of special matrices show that {CALU} is stable in practice. The upper bound on the growth factor of {CALU} is worse than that of {GEPP}. However, there are Wilkinson-like matrices for which {GEPP} has exponential growth factor, but not {CALU}, and vice-versa.},
